# AnalyzingBostonAirbnbData

Can we guess what Boston's Airbnb market was like a few years ago? This project is an analysis of Boston's Airbnb data (2016-2017). 

A step-by-step approach on how to answer a few insights regarding Boston's rental market through Airbnb.

## Installation
In order to run this project the following packages will need to be installed: 
	• Python version 3.6 
	
	• 'pandas' version 0.18.0 or later
	
	• 'numpy' version 1.7 or later 
	
	• 'matplotlib' version 1.3 or later 
	
	• 'seaborn' 

## Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to better understand the Airbnb market in Boston during 2016-2017. Through this we were able to gather insights for the following three business questions: 

	1. During what months can we expect peak season for Airbnb bookings? 

	2. Are there certain neighborhoods that are highly rated compared to others? 
	
	3. Which attributes are highly correlated with listing price? 
	
## File Descriptions
One main notebook was used to answer our three business questions. The data sources that were used are: 

	1. 'listings.csv' - This file contains detailed information about each listing with ~95 different variables
	
	2. 'reviews.csv' - This file contains review scores and detailed comments for each listing
	
	3. 'calendar.csv' - This file contains availability and price for that day  
	
The data sources were gathered from kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston.
